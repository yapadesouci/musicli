## Troubleshooting

### Can I search multiple artists at the same time?

No, you can't. It's one artist at a time.

### How can I select artists?

Press the SPACE bar to check/uncheck selectboxes.

### I always a 'No playlist loaded...' message.

You must create a playlist and load it with the load command.

### I have created a playlist, selected some artists but when I run the play command, nothing happen.

Verify that MPlayer is installed. If yes, don't forget to refresh your playlist. Refreshing can take a long time. Please be patient!
